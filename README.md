- Gave the user a tally of their score. 

### Lab 03
- Asked a 6th question for a number, and gave the user 4 guesses. If they didn't get it, I told them what the correct answer was. 
- Asked a 7th question for a string, and gave the user 6 guesses, then told them what all the correct guesses would have been. 
- Gave the user a tally of their score.
